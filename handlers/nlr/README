1. You must have a file named /tmp/NLRSherpa.properties with
NLRSherpa.login
NLRSherpa.password
NLRSherpa.wg 
properties in it for testing. Otherwise credentials are stored in a property file under $ORCA_HOME

2. Some tasks are for testing only (e.g. reserveAnyVlanId - it gets the first available vlan id and reserves it, printing the id as an exit code).

3. Execute tasks as $> ant -f test.xml <task name>

4. Use ant -f test.xml -projecthelp to list tasks

5. To test VLAN provisioning live the following sequence should be followed:
  ant -f test.xml reserveAnyVlanId
  <the NLRSherpa.reservedVlan property will be the ID of the vlan reserved in the previous step, in this
  case it is 211>
  ant -f test.xml -DNLRSherpa.vlan_id=211 provisionVlan 
  ant -f test.xml -DNLRSherpa.vlan_id=211 removeVlan
