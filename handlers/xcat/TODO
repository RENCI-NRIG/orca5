Windows bare metal images (if found to be possible) may need disablement of
the SSH check. We may need to see if we can check for an available RDP port.
Is there a means to check in RDP for a "valid" response?
Check VCL xcat handler for means of credential injection.

Perhaps come up with a means of cleaning up "stale" instances - namely, instances that
belong to slices that no longer exist (are slice names globally unique enough to make this work)?
