Generating a Security Configuration

  {{{index.html}\<\<Back to contents}}

 The configuration tools provide the means to generate the security
 configuration for an Orca container.  The security configuration resides
 in the container's <runtime> directory (see the
 {{{../container-configuration/config-files.html}configuration files}}
 referece).  It includes a keystore with
 keys for the container administrator and for Orca actors (service
 managers, brokers, and site authorities) inhabiting the container.

 Once you have created the settings for a given actor or for the admin, you will
 need to copy the corresponding files to the corresponding directories under
 $ORCA_HOME/runtime. The easiest approach is to make $ORCA_HOME/runtime be a
 link to $ORCA_ROOT/tools/config/runtime.

 All commands are relative to $ORCA_ROOT/tools/config. 
 
 
* Admin security configuration

 To generate the admin security configuration type the following in
 your terminal:

+---
ant security.create.admin.config
+---

 This will create a folder in the current directory called
 <runtime>.   Various other tools operate on the keystore in the runtime
 folder.  Later you will place the runtime folder in $ROOT_DIR/runtime in your container configuration, e.g., copy or link the resulting <runtime> folder to either $ORCA_ROOT/run
 or $ORCA_ROOT/portal/webapp depending on how you plan to launch your Orca container.

 <<Note:>> The config tool fails if a runtime folder already exists in the current directory: remove it or move it of the way if you run config more than once.  Note that
 if you remove it you discard all security keys stored in the admin keystore.

 <<Note:>> Keys generated in this step are later shared with other nodes, who may reject
 those keys if the node clocks are not reasonably synchronized.  More on that can be
 found on the {{{security.html}Node Agent security}} page.
 
 
* Actor security configuration

 You can use the configuration tools to generate the security
 configuration for an actor. Note that this is not required, since
 Orca will generate new security configuration for each actor that
 does not have one.
 
 To generate the security configuration for a given actor type the
 following in your terminal:

+---
ant security.create.actor.config -Dactor=ACTOR_GUID
+---

 Where ACTOR_GUID is the guid of the actor.

 This will create a folder in the current directory called <runtime>
 (if it does not already exist). The directory will contain the
 security configuration files for the specified actor.

 <<Note:>> see notes in previous section.
