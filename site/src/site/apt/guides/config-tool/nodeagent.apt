Node Agent Service

  {{{index.html}\<\<Back to contents}}

* Preliminaries  
 
 All commands are relative to $ORCA_ROOT/tools/config on the
 control node.

 The control node must be empowered to execute actions as root on the target
 nodes using passwordless ssh.
 Each command
 executes on a list of target machines listed in ant/user.properties.
 See the {{{prepare.html}prepare instructions}}).
   
 The Node Agent service itself is built within $ORCA_ROOT/nodeagent, and
 packaged in an aar file (Apache Axis archive).  Be sure to do a <mvn install>
 in $ORCA_ROOT/nodeagent to be sure the archive is up to date before installing
 it on the targets.

* Node Agent host install

 This command installs the Node Agent host software, but not the Node Agent
 service itself.  It copies and unpacks a large tar archive onto the
 target nodes.
 
+---
ant nah.install
+---

* Node Agent install

 This command installs the Node Agent service itself (the <aar> file) and
 starts or restarts the service.  It is the same as <na.upgrade>.
 
+---
ant na.install
+---

* Node Agent upgrade

 This command upgrades the Node Agent service and restarts it, e.g.,
 after building a new archive.
 
+---
ant na.upgrade
+---

* Node Agent status

 To check the status of the Node Agent service type the following in
 your terminal.  This command just checks to see if something is
 listening on port 6 on each target node.

+--- 
ant na.status
+---

 <<Note:>> This command requires a locally installed
 {{{http://insecure.org/nmap/}nmap}}.  If there is no nmap installed
 it may just tell you that your Node Agents are down without checking first.


* Node Agent start

 To start the Node Agent service type the following in your terminal.
 Note that install/upgrade starts the service automatically.

+--- 
ant na.start
+---

* Node Agent stop

 To stop the Node Agent service type the following in your terminal.
 Note that install/upgrade will stop and restart the service automatically.

+--- 
ant na.stop
+---

* Node Agent restart

 To restart the Node Agent service type the following in your terminal.

+--- 
ant na.restart
+---

* Notes and Gotchas

 These ant scripts operate on the node agent in some ways that may be
 OS-specific.  They install a script called <na> in </etc/init.d> on 
 each target node.  The node agent distribution itself goes in
 </root/na>.  These paths are hard-coded in a few of the ant
 scripts (FIXME).  They work for Debian.

 The agent listens on port <na.port>, which defaults to 6.  If
 something else listens on port 6 first then start may fail
 silently.

 The agent leaves log files under </root/na/log> on each target node.
 Some errors are reported only in the log, so it is a good idea to look at
 the log if you suspect a problem.  The agent fails silently if
 it runs out of space for its log.

 Some problems have resulted from failure to <mvn install> in the
 nodeagent directory on the development machine before installing
 the "new" service archive on the targets.

 When the agent starts, the <na> script places its process ID in a file.
 To stop it, <na> kills the process at the saved process ID.  If the
 process ID is ever corrupted, then start and stop currently may 
 fail silently.  That "should not happen" using these tools, but it
 will happen if you remove </root/na> manually.  You do not
 need to do that: <nah.install> cleans out all state in </root/na>,
 including installed drivers and the Node Agent archive.  It
 leaves only the log files intact.

 If you suspect the pid files are out of sync for any
 reason, it is easy
 to find the java na process on the target node with ps,
 and kill it manually.
 Then <na.start> will reset the pid files.

 Keeping clocks synchronized will help to avoid trouble later.
 The undocumented command <na.time> installs ntp on all the
 target nodes (using apt-get, which works for Debian), and
 <na.showtime> shows the times on all the target nodes.
