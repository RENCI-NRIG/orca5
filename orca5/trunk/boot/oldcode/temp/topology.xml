<!--
    This file describes the actor topology.
    Each link defines a relationship between two actors.

    The end points of a link trust each other's public keys. In real life,
    these keys are established using some out-of-band mechanisms. In our case,
    we pre-populate the keys and ensure that actors know about them.
    
    The directionality of links depends on the nature of the actors.
