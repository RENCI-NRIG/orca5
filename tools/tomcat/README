This package defines a class loader to be used by the Shirako web
application when it is installed inside a Tomcat application
server. This class loader allows the system to add and upgrade new
libraries dynamically without restarting the application.

Using the class loader requires several steps:

1. Copy net.exogeni.shirako.tomcat.server*.jar to CATALINA_HOME/server/lib
2. Copy net.exogeni.shirako.tomcat.common*.jar to CATALINA_HOME/common/lib
3. Add the following line to Shirako's context.xml file:
   <Loader loaderClass="net.exogeni.shirako.util.tomcat.ShirakoWebappClassLoader"/>
4. To enable jar files to be resolved dynamically at runtime, create
an instance of ShirakoURLClassLoader. Obtain the context class loader
(Thread.currentThread().getContenxtClassLoader()), typecast it to
IShirakoClassLoader, and register the loader you created.

5. Disable jar files to be resolved dynamically at runtime, obtain the
   context class laoder, and unregister the class loader for you jar
   files.

6. To upgrade jar files: unregister the corresponding ShirakoURLClassLoaded, create a new loader,
   and register it.
