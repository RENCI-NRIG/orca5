This directory contains help scripts to build Orca.

To get an initial build follow the following instructions

0. Create a working directory
   
   mkdir ORCA_HOME

1. Checkout the build files

   cd ORCA_HOME
   svn co https://geni-orca.renci.org/svn/orca/build-all/trunk build-all

2. Link build.xml

   ln -s build-all/build.xml build.xml

3. Fetch the sources

   ant get.all 


4. Install the geni-orca repository certificate (only if you have never done this before)

   ant get.certificate

Note: you need to have JAVA_HOME set to invoke this command. If you require administrative privileges
to add a certificate to your java keystore, try the following:

   ant get.certificate.sudo

If this fails, please take a look at build-all/getcertificate.sh and try to modify it to fit your environment.

5. Prepare the tree
   
   ant prepare.build


6. Build the whole tree

   mvn install

After the first build, you can build all projects (or individual projects)
directly. Simply go to the directory that contains the project
you want to rebuild and type:

   mvn install


Before you can work with the source tree, you need to perform several
preparation steps: e.g., generate a security configuration and add a number of
symbolic links. The ant build file provides a task to automate this process.

   ant prepare.use
